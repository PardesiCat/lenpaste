# Frequently Asked Questions
## Why such a name?
In the USSR, some organizations were named according to the principle:
abbreviated name of city + main activity of the organization.
For example: LenFilm, MosGas.
Lenpaste repeats this tradition.

## What are the system requirements?
There aren't any. In fact, Lenpaste is so lightweight that you can run it almost anywhere.
At idle time the container uses about 10 MB of RAM, it uses almost no CPU,
and the disk load is also minimal (all HTML pages are loaded into memory at startup).

## Why isn't the source code posted on GitHub?
There are several reasons why I don't use GitHub,
all of which are detailed [here](https://git.lcomrade.su/root/give-up-github).
Here I will only describe the basic idea.

GitHub has gained too much power over open source developers.
It's time to take that power away from the capitalists.
