# Roadmap for v1.2 release
The release of 1.2 is planned to be quite voluminous in spite of the serial number. The following are planned:
1. EULA page. It is only needed to protect the server administrator from legal problems.
2. Tab "History". In this tab will be displayed pastes created from this device.
3. HTTP Authication Basic. A list of users and their hashed passwords will be stored in a file similar in syntax to `.htpasswd`.
Authorization will be required only to create the pastes.
4. The `-default-paste-lifetime` flag and the environment variable for the Docker container `LENPASTE_DEFAULT_PASTE_LIFETIME`.
Intended to set the default lifetime value selected in the web interface.
The value of this parameter will not be forwarded through the API.

I need help creating a **Lenpaste logo**.
If you are ready to create a logo (favicon) and license it under a Creative Commons license
(I need it so there would be no legal problems), then email me at root@lcomrade.su
